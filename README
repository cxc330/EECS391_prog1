This programming assignment was built off of SimpleRTS, a open source RTS game provided by the professor and a group of students.

Running Instructions:
    Using our provided shell scripts, which will both compile and run the files for you using proj1.config as its configuration:
        Use rcagent2.sh to run the RCAgent2.
	    Use searchAgent.sh to run the searchAgent. Edit the map portion of the cmd to change the map used.

Description:
    First, we were tasked to create a simple agent, called RCAgent2 that does the following:
        1. Collect enough Gold to build two Peasants
        2. Build two Peasants
        3. Collect enough Gold and Wood using all three peasants to build a Farm
        4. Build a Farm
        5. Collect enough Gold and Wood using all three peasants to build a Barracks
        6. Build a Barracks
        7. Collect enough Gold using all three peasants to build two Footmen
        8. Build Two Footmen
    The source code for this agent can be found in the RCAgent2.java file.

    Secondly, we were tasked to create another agent that can move around a map by using the A* search algorithm.
    We must use primitiveMoves as specified by the game and must implement a heuristic function. A recommended heuristic is the Chebyshev 
    distance (defined as: D((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = max (|x2-x1|, |y2-y1|).
    The source code for the second agent that finds a path on the map using A* search can be found in the SearchAgent.java file. 

Note:
    As a programming assignment, we will try to optimize for space/runtime when obvious, but will not focus the majority of our efforts on doing so.
