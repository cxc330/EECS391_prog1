This programming assignment is built off of SimpleRTS, a open source RTS game provided by the professor.

We are tasked to create a simple agent, called RCAgent2  that does the following:
    1. Collect enough Gold to build two Peasants
    2. Build two Peasants
    3. Collect enough Gold and Wood using all three peasants to build a Farm
    4. Build a Farm
    5. Collect enough Gold and Wood using all three peasants to build a Barracks
    6. Build a Barracks
    7. Collect enough Gold using all three peasants to bujild two Footmen
    8. Build Two Footmen

Secondly, we are tasked to create another agent that can move around a map by implementing the A* search algorithm.
We must use primitiveMoves as specified by the game and must implement a heuristic function. A recommended heuristic is the Chebyshev 
distance (defined as: D((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = max (|x2-x1|, |y2-y1|).

The A* search code will be implemented in SearchAgent.java. As a programming assignment, we will try to optimize for space/runtime 
when obvious, but will not focus the majority of our efforts on doing so.
